# About Me
Senior Software Engineer | AI & GenAI Advocate | Community Builder

With years of experience in software engineering, I’m currently focused on leading and building practical AI & GenAI-powered solutions that actually solve real problems - not just prototypes or buzzwords.

👾 Whether it's crafting intelligent agents, experimenting with the latest AI tools, or helping teams integrate AI into their workflows, I’m all about making AI accessible, useful, and impactful.

🌍 I’m also the co-founder of the Arab AI Lab - a grassroots initiative dedicated to empowering Arab communities through AI education, hands-on workshops, and real-world tools. We’re on a mission to close the AI knowledge gap in our society.

🤝 I build, mentor, and constantly learn - and I believe in sharing that journey openly.

📩 Let’s connect and explore how AI can work for people, not just impress them. Reach out:
